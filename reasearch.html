            Beliefs evolve over time due to cultural changes, scientific advances, and the evolution of beliefs. Customs such as "touching the tree" originally arose from ancient pagan traditions where people believed that spirits lived in trees. Over the centuries, these beliefs were often adapted or changed as society modernized, sometimes merged with new interpretations or forgotten as people's worldviews changed.
<br>            
            Ways of values ​​and beliefs follow in the world
            Here are some family values ​​to follow:
<br>            
            Loyalty and devotion to family. Support each other, care for each other and take care of each other's health.
            Respect the elders and strong people in the family. Open communication, share feelings, resolve conflicts.
            Promote cultural traditions, heritage and religious/spiritual beliefs. Emphasizes education, hard work and personal responsibility.
            Prefers quality time with family. Inculcate values ​​such as honesty, integrity and kindness.
            Provide a stable, nurturing and loving home environment. Learn children appropriate behavior and social skills. Promote a sense of affliction, identity and common purpose. Here are some of the beliefs that are followed around the world:
<br>            
            "Knocking on Wood" Indo-European, Celtic or possibly British. The actual origins and even meanings of the phrase are as varied as the cultures that use it, with some suggesting roots in the Indo-European or Celtic belief that spirits good and bad resided in trees, which could either be invoked for protection or chased away by knocking on their homes, and others (especially Christians) associate the practice with the magical power of the wooden crucifix.
            Salt over your shoulder” European/Christian, Ancient Roman Perhaps the second most common superstition, at least in the West, involves throwing salt over one's shoulder. Like \"knocking on wood,\" this superstition also involves the idea of ​​\"warding off the devil\" -- in this case, the devil himself. In Leonardo da Vinci\'s \"The Last Supper,\" Judas Iscariot, the betrayal of Jesus, is depicted accidentally spilling salt. The argument is that since Judas is associated with evil, it is also associated with salt, and throwing it over the shoulder will blind the devil waiting there.
            "Walking Under Stairs" The European/Christian, possibly Egyptian, superstition of not wanting to walk under stairs also derives from Christian symbolism. The "Holy Trinity" of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit connects the number 3 with the divine. . A three-sided triangle is also considered sacred, and since a ladder naturally forms a triangle, naturally, to step under the ladder would be to destroy the sanctity of the Trinity and would bring about punishment.
<br>            
            "Stepping on the Crack Will Break Your Mother\'s Back\" African and European Folklore Another superstition that suggests that cracked or broken objects are associated with bad luck is that of \"stepping on a crack\" which predicts or even brings about bad luck for a member of the family. Why have your values ​​and beliefs changed?
<br>            
            Life Experience and Reflection: Exposure to different situations and people broadens your perspective and often leads to self-awareness. Difficult experiences make you rethink and reevaluate your values.
<br>            
            Cultural and social influence: Society and culture shape values ​​through norms, traditions and expectations. Exposure to different cultures and social movements can develop empathy and tolerance, leading to adjustments in values. Education and Intellectual Growth: Learning and critical thinking introduce new ideas and philosophies into educational institutions. This intellectual stimulation challenges prejudices and encourages a reassessment of values. Environment and Global Change: Environmental crises and global events cause changes in values. For example, climate change promotes values ​​that define sustainability, while political unrest or pandemics force people to rethink priorities. Personal growth and development: Of course, maturity and self-reflection lead to changes in values. People are better able to understand their own desires and thus be able to shift their own values ​​in response to their developing identities. Changes in principles and theories can have many consequences, including: Impact on friendships. Shared principles can create a sense of community and belonging, while conflicting principles can lead to misunderstandings and conflict. Impact on status. Beliefs and values ​​can shape a person's position towards opportunities, depending on how they perceive people, places and goods, communicate and accompany the rest of something, behave, think and experience despair. For example, middle-aged people who live in abusive homes may give rise to negative opinions about the merger, whereas cautious people who work hard to grant permission may give rise to some opinions about the integrity of the work.</p>
